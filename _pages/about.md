I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology. While my major is EEE, my professional focus has shifted entirely toward Computational Sciences and Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I am deep-diving into Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am actively working on replicating complex architectures. To support this research, I am rigorously building my mathematical foundations through advanced Python implementation.

I aim to bridge the gap between Electrical systems and modern AI applications, potentially for the industrial sector. I also spend my downtime studying the cultural and industrial landscapes of the Texas Oil & Gas Industry.

For more of my code and paper replications, check out my GitHub page.
